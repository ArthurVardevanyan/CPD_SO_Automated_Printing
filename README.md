# CPD_SO_Automated_Printing

A Specialized Script for Running one Customers High Volume Orders

### Known Bugs:
* Entering an Order # Shorter than the desired one may result in the incorrect order getting picked. Generally not an issue, order can be skipped on confirm screen.
* Occasionally Customer Provides two Jobs with the same order number, in that case, one is picked, and if it is not the right one, you can not run that order.
* If the Order has Invalid* or Unrealistic inputs, if a human does not catch it, the order will be wrong. (Some Invalid inputs will be caught by the script)
* Can't Print Password Locked or Corrupt Files.

### TODO

* Add Slip-sheets to collated sets with high page counts, ~10 or more sheets


## Two Main Files:

#### Email.py 
Fetches The Emails and calls other functions to setup and preprocess jobs.
#### Print.py 
This is the Printing Utility. It prints mostly autonomously for the inputted orders, main aspects it still asks for are which printer to use and if the "Special Instructions" field is filled out, it has someone verify and input information.

## Other Files Include:

#### files.py 
Grabs list of files and folders
#### PostScript.py 
Converts the PDFS to PS Files , also merges postscript files when needed.
#### SchoolDataJson.py
Converts the Email text into a JSON file
#### GDrive.py  
Downloads the files for the order from Google Drive
#### BannerSheet.py  
Generates a custom banner sheet for running these jobs. Outputted in front of each job before all the files get outputted.
